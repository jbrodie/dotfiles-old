# Installation complete! You should see the Zeal app in your applications
# directory. OSX will complain about the app being from an unidenfied developer,
# so you need to tell it to allow Zeal.

# For use on the command line add this to your .bashrc:

#     alias zeal='/Applications/Zeal.app/Contents/MacOS/Zeal'
